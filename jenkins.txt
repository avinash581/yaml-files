	- All the pipeline code is defined in groovy format (java).
	- we can define our pipeline code in ways 
			1. Inline pipeline script.
			2. we can write pipeline in a file called Jenkinsfile and we call it from a SCM.
	
	- The default stage of pipeline is 'Declarative: Checkout SCM' in this stage 
	  jenkins will pull the latest Jenkinsfile	
	
	What are the types of pipeline in jenikns 
		1. scripted pipeline
			- old way/ traditional way of defining pipeline code 
			- Most of the operation we need to write in code which is groovy.
			- we define all scripted pipeline in node block 
				
				node {
					.....
					.....
				}
				
		2. declarative pipeline
			  - new way of writing jenkins groovy pipeline
			  - all code is defined inside the pipeline block	
				
				pipeline {
						.....
						.....
				}
				
		
	Jenkinsfile example 
		pipeline {
			agent any 
			stages {
				stage('BUILD') {
					steps {
						sh '''
							#!/bin/bash 
							echo "This is a fist build stage in Jenkinsfile"
						'''
					}
				}
				stage('TEST1') {
					steps {
						sh 'echo "fist test stage in Jenkinsfile"'
					}	
				}
				stage('TEST2') {
					steps {
						sh 'echo "Second test stage in Jenkinsfile"'
					}	
				}
				stage('DEPLOY') {
					steps {
						sh 'echo "Final DEPLOY stage in Jenkinsfile"'
					}
				}
			}
